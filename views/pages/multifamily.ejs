        The Nashville portfolio is a 81-unit apartment portfolio built in 1984, 1985 and 2010. The properties are located in rapidly growing Nashville,TN which has led the nation in job growth over the past 2 years. The portfolio was acquired in April 2014 from a private seller who had purchased the units as part of an attempted condo conversion in 2007. The properties are well maintained with amenities that are superior to those in its competitive set.  Rents are currently significantly below market and will be increased 7%-11% upon renewals and for new leases. The seller had a cost basis approximately $4m higher than the Fund’s purchase price of the assets. Properties are presently 100% occupied with a waiting list.

  <h2>Defoors Crossing</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p>
        The Defoors property is a 60 unit property built in 2007 in the well located Collier Hills neighborhood which is between Buckhead and West Midtown (home of Georgia Tech). The area is experiencing a tremendous amount of redevelopment/activity due to its proximate location to numerous employment centers, and life style amenities. The property is currently 99% occupied with rents at $1.12 level with new leases being signed at $1.22. There are a few new developed properties in the area that are achieving rents in the $1.40-$1.70 level. The property presently offers a lower cost alternative to the newly developed properties. The Manager believes that rents can be increased 8%-12% by performing upgrades on the interior of the units and minor clean up of the common areas. The Manager also believes ancillary income can be increased by adding various additional charges not being charged by the existing owner. The area surrounding the complex continues to be redeveloped including the shopping center immediately next door on one side and the empty lot on the other side that is being developed with Townhomes. The complex will feature “walkability” to several nearby restaurants, bars, and shops.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Exceptional projected investment returns (annual cash on cash returns greater than 10%; Projected gross IRR 24% for a 5 year hold
        </li>
        <li>
          The asset was acquired at below replacement costs and is well located in an area of Atlanta that is has a significant amount of development and redevelopment activity surrounding the assets
        </li>
        <li>
          The current rents are below market and even at market rate will provide renters a lower cost alternative to the newer complexes that are presently being built. Present rents are approximately $1.12 psf. New development is achieving rates in the $1.40 -1.70 psf range. This differential should allow for rent growth both organically and through upgraded units.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rental growth will occur both organically and as a result of upgrading interior units at a cost of $4k per unit. It is anticipated that upgraded rental units will command a $100-$150 premium vs non-upgraded units. The complex is proximate to Buckhead and Midtown and provides convenient access to job centers, shopping, educational institutions and other amenities. Atlanta and Georgia are both experiencing high amounts of job growth. The asset is currently 95% occupied and it is anticipated that the strong occupancy will continue due to its prime location
        </li>
        <li>
          The Manager believes that this asset is in the initial stage of significant rent growth as a result of a combination of strong local job growth, development activity in the immediate area and additional rental income that may be generated by rehabbing the unit interiors

  <h2>Dominion House</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p>
        Dominion House, a 200 unit property in the Antioch area of Nashville, was built in 1973 by the current owners.  SEMP I purchased this community in July 2015 from the current owner who owned the property for approximately 40 years and sold because his existing loan was maturing and he was retiring and diversifying his real estate holdings. The property has been running at 96%-99%% occupancy and SMP believes the rents are below those in the market and there are operational efficiencies to be captured primarily through yield management on the pricing of the units.  SMP believes that the property will generate significant revenue and NOI growth through a combination of organic growth, rental increase from upgraded units and management improvements. The submarket is also running at very high occupancy which should provide for rental growth during the future. The Purchase price of the property was $13.51M ($67.5K per unit) which equates to a 6.8 Cap Rate on year 1 NOI.  Closing costs were approximately $600k and the rehab budget is approximately $450k, that brought the total acquisition budget to $14.5M. Estimated cash returns are 12%-14% in year one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deal Highlights:
      </p>
      <p>
        SMP will perform upgrades on the 90 units that have not been previously renovated.  The cost of the upgrade will be $2,800-$3,200 and will be done at turnover. SMP believes it will take 2 years to upgrade these units.  The clubhouse will also be updated to provide a more modern look for residents and potential residents.  SMP is exploring whether washer/dryer connection can be added to the units that presently aren’t equipped with such which would further enhance the revenue potential of the property.  After the units are upgraded SMP will seek to put permanent financing on the property either CMBS/Agency or a HUD loan that would provide fixed rate interest for 35 year at 83% LTV. A refinance in year 2 or year 3 would provide for a significant return of equity to investors.
